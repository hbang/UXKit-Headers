# UXKit Headers
These headers are derived from reverse engineering the UXKit framework, found within `PhotoLibraryPrivate.framework` on OS X 10.10.3. This is a work in progress to create useful and clean headers, like I [already do](https://github.com/hbang/headers) for iOS private frameworks, although entire classes are being added rather than only the methods and properties being used.

Contributions are most definitely appreciated - just be sure to keep to the existing coding style.
